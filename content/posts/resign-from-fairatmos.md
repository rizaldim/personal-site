title: Yesterday is my last day at Fairatmos
---

I resigned from my job at Fairatmos around two months ago and last friday is my
last day. This is my longest notice period I think. I have resigned from a
full-time position in total 3 times now and in the 2 other occasions it was
always 1 month. But I can say that I am grateful that this one is 2 months.

When I told my direct lead that I had made up my mind and my decision is final,
I thought that it was a good decision. Now, after 2 months and after the last
day working and saying good bye to my colleagues in the tech-product team, I
don't know whether it's a good decision but I do know that I have to leave.
When I resigned from Bridestory, where I worked the longest, I was sad but
I was kinda relieved that I moved on. But this one now, I just think that I am
sad that it comes to this. So many things that I set out to do but most of them
aren't finished or even started.

I got a lot of invaluable experience working in Fairatmos. This is my first time
working as a solo Ops person. It's also the first time that I am involved in
a certification process. This is also the first time that I can say that I am
one of the more senior engineer in my team. I know it's crazy to say that because
I am in my late thirties now but that's just the way my life has been.

So, Fairatmos is my third company in less than 2 years. The next one is the
fourth. I hope in this one I can stay longer. For years hopefully. But I don't
know. I am just few years away from 40 now and I hope before I got there I am
in a better situation financially, healthwise, and also career-wise.

For my colleagues at Fairatmos, I hope that they will succeed in what they set out
to do. Especially for my colleagues in the tech-product team. I wish all the good
things for them. For their career, their health, and all the best to their families.
I hope that we will cross path again one day.
